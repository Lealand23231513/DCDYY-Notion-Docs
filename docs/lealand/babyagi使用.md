参考Readme，使用docker安装。

## Pre：

将requirements.txt的内容替换为：

```python

chromadb==0.3.21
pre-commit>=3.2.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
tiktoken==0.3.3
llama-cpp-python>=0.1.42
```

## 安装过程Bug：PydanticImportError: ’BaseSettings’ has been moved to the `pydantic-settings` package.

```powershell

babyagi  | *****TASK RESULT*****
babyagi  |
babyagi  | To conduct research and analysis on solving world hunger, we need to gather data and information from various sources. Here is a step-by-step approach to conducting this research:
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 1. Define the scope: Determine the specific aspects of world hunger that you want to focus on. This could include understanding the causes of hunger, identifying regions or populations most affected, analyzing current interventions and their effectiveness, or exploring potential solutions.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 2. Gather data: Collect relevant data from reputable sources such as international organizations (e.g., United Nations, World Bank), research institutions, and government reports. Look for data on hunger statistics, food production and distribution, agricultural practices, poverty levels, climate change impacts, and other related factors.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 3. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods and analytical tools to analyze the collected data. Identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can provide insights into the causes and consequences of hunger. Look for gaps in the data or areas where further research is needed.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 4. Review existing research: Conduct a literature review to identify existing research and studies on solving world hunger. This will help you understand the current state of knowledge, identify gaps in research, and build upon existing findings. Look for academic papers, reports, and case studies that provide insights into successful interventions or innovative approaches.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 5. Identify key stakeholders: Identify the key stakeholders involved in addressing world hunger, such as governments, NGOs, international organizations, farmers, and local communities. Understand their roles, perspectives, and challenges they face in implementing solutions. Consider conducting interviews or surveys to gather their insights and experiences.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 6. Evaluate existing interventions: Assess the effectiveness of existing interventions and policies aimed at reducing hunger. Look for evidence-based evaluations and impact assessments to determine what has worked and what hasn't. Identify best practices and lessons learned that can inform future strategies.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 7. Explore innovative solutions: Research and analyze innovative approaches and technologies that can help solve world hunger. This could include advancements in agricultural practices, sustainable food production systems, food waste reduction, and improved access to nutritious food. Consider the potential impact, feasibility, and scalability of these solutions.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 8. Consider policy implications: Analyze the policy and regulatory frameworks related to food security and hunger. Assess the effectiveness of existing policies and identify areas where policy changes or improvements are needed. Consider the political, economic, and social factors that influence policy decisions and implementation.    
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 9. Synthesize findings: Summarize and synthesize the research findings into a comprehensive report or presentation. Clearly communicate the key insights, recommendations, and potential solutions to address world hunger. Consider the implications for policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | 10. Share and disseminate findings: Share the research findings with relevant stakeholders, policymakers, and the wider public. Publish the research report, present at conferences, or engage in advocacy efforts to raise awareness and promote evidence-based solutions to solve world hunger.
babyagi  |
babyagi  | By conducting thorough research and analysis, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex issue of world hunger and identify effective strategies to address it.

babyagi是个轻量级的AI助理，其关键设计目标是保持简单。

持续执行，不会自己停止。需要及时在docker停止container。

包含另外一个模块，babycoder，可以写代码。

更改目标需要关闭docker中的container，在终端重新启动。
